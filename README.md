A package to run an energy system integration model called SpineOpt.

### Compatibility

This package requires [Julia](https://julialang.org/) 1.2 or later.

### Installation

SpineOpt is designed to be used with [Spine Toolbox](https://github.com/Spine-project/Spine-Toolbox).

1. Install Spine Toolbox as described [here](https://github.com/Spine-project/Spine-Toolbox/blob/master/README.md#installation).

2. Download and install the latest version of Julia for your system as described [here](https://julialang.org/downloads).

3. Start the [Julia REPL](https://github.com/Spine-project/SpineOpt.jl/raw/master/docs/src/figs/win_run_julia.png).

4. Copy/paste the following text into the julia prompt
(it will install the SpineOpt package from the [Spine Julia Registry](https://github.com/Spine-project/SpineJuliaRegistry)):

	```julia
	using Pkg
	pkg"registry add General https://github.com/Spine-project/SpineJuliaRegistry"
	pkg"add SpineOpt"
	```

5. Configure Spine Toolbox to use your Julia:

	a. Run Spine Toolbox.

	b. Go to **File** -> **Settings** -> **Tools**.

	c. Under **Julia**, enter the path to your Julia executable. It should look something like [this](https://github.com/Spine-project/SpineOpt.jl/raw/master/docs/src/figs/spinetoolbox_settings_juliaexe.png).

	d. Press **Ok**.

It doesn't work? See our [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

### Upgrading

SpineOpt is constantly improving. To get the most recent version, just:

1. Start the [Julia REPL](https://github.com/Spine-project/SpineOpt.jl/raw/master/docs/src/figs/win_run_julia.png).

2. Copy/paste the following text into the julia prompt
(it will update the SpineOpt package from the [Spine Julia Registry](https://github.com/Spine-project/SpineJuliaRegistry)):

	```julia
	using Pkg
	pkg"up SpineOpt"
	```

### Usage

For an example of how to use SpineOpt in your Spine Toolbox projects,
please see [here](https://spine-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_study_a5.html).
(We apologize for the lengthiness of that example. We're currently working on a minimal example that will get you started faster.)

### Documentation

SpineOpt documentation, including getting started guide and reference, can be found here: [Documentation](https://spine-project.github.io/SpineOpt.jl/latest/index.html).
Alternatively, one can build the documentation locally, as it is bundled in with the source code.

First, **navigate into the SpineOpt main folder** and activate the `docs` environment from the julia package manager:

```julia
(SpineOpt) pkg> activate docs
(docs) pkg>
```

Next, in order to make sure that the `docs` environment uses the same SpineOpt version it is contained within,
install the package locally into the `docs` environment:

```julia
(docs) pkg> develop .
Resolving package versions...
<lots of packages being checked>
(docs) pkg>
```

Now, you should be able to build the documentation by exiting the package manager and typing:

```julia
julia> include("docs/make.jl")
```

This should build the documentation on your computer, and you can access it in the `docs/build/` folder.

### Troubleshooting

#### Problem

Using Julia 1.5.3 on Windows, installation fails with one of the following messages (or similar):

```julia
julia>  pkg"add SpineOpt"
   Updating registry at `C:\Users\manuelma\.julia\registries\General`
   Updating git-repo `https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General.git`
   Updating registry at `C:\Users\manuelma\.julia\registries\SpineRegistry`
   Updating git-repo `https://github.com/Spine-project/SpineJuliaRegistry`
  Resolving package versions...

```julia
julia>  pkg"add SpineOpt"
   Updating registry at `C:\Users\manuelma\.julia\registries\SpineRegistry`
   Updating git-repo `https://github.com/Spine-project/SpineJuliaRegistry`
  Resolving package versions...
ERROR: cannot find name corresponding to UUID f269a46b-ccf7-5d73-abea-4c690281aa53 in a registry
...
 ```

#### Solution

1. Reset your Julia General registry. Copy/paste the following in the julia prompt:

	```julia
	using Pkg
	rm(joinpath(DEPOT_PATH[1], "registries", "General"); force=true, recursive=true)
	withenv("JULIA_PKG_SERVER"=>"") do
	    pkg"registry add"
	end
	```
2. Try to install SpineOpt again.

#### Problem

On Windows 7, installation fails with the following message (or similar):

```julia
julia>  pkg"add SpineOpt"
...
Downloading artifact: OpenBLAS32
Exception setting "SecurityProtocol": "Cannot convert null to type "System.Net.

```

#### Solution

1. Install .NET 4.5 from here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=30653.

2. Install Windows management framework 3 or later, from here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/wmf/overview?view=powershell-7.1.

3. Try to install SpineOpt again.
