By defining the fom\_cost parameter for a specific `unit`, a cost term will be added to the objective function to account for the fixed operation and maintenance costs associated with that unit during the current optimization window. fom\_cost differs from units\_on\_cost in a way that the fixed operation and maintenance costs apply to both the online and offline unit.
