The definition of the `min_total_cumulated_unit_flow_to_node` parameter will trigger the creation of the [constraint\_total\_cumulated\_unit\_flow](@ref constraint_total_cumulated_unit_flow). It sets a lower bound on the sum of the [unit\_flow](@ref) variable for all timesteps.

It can be defined for the [unit\_\_to\_node](@ref) relationships, as well as their counterparts for node- and unit groups. It will then restrict the total accumulation of `unit_flow` variables to be above the given value. A possible use case is a minimum value for electricity generated from renewable sources. The parameter is given as an absolute value thus has to be coherent with the units used for the unit flows.
