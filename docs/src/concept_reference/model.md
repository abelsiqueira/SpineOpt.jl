The model object holds general information about the optimization problem at hand. Firstly, the modelling horizon is specified on the model object, i.e. the scope of the optimization model, and if applicable the duration of the rolling window (see also [model\_start](@ref), [model\_end](@ref) and [roll\_forward](@ref)). Secondly, the model works as an overarching assembler - only through linking [temporal\_block](@ref)s and [stochastic\_structure](@ref)s to a model object via relationships, they become part of the optimization problem, and respectively linked nodes, connections and units. If desired the user can also specify defaults for temporals and stochastic via the designated default relationships (see e.g., [model\_\_default\_temporal\_block](@ref)). In this case, the default temporal is populated for missing [node\_\_temporal\_block](@ref) relationships.
Lastly, the model object contains information about the algorithm used for solving the problem (see [model\_type](@ref)).
