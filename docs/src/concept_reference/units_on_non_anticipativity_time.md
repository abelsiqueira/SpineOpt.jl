The [units\_on\_non\_anticipativity\_time](@ref) parameter defines the duration, starting from the begining
of the optimisation window, where [units\_on](@ref) variables need to be fixed to the result of the previous window.

This is intended to model "slow" units whose commitment decision needs to be taken in advance, e.g., in "day-ahead" mode,
and cannot be changed afterwards.
