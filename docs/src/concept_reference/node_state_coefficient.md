The [node\_state\_coefficient](@ref) is an optional parameter that can be used to include the [node\_state](@ref)
variable of a [node](@ref) in a [user\_constraint](@ref) via the [node\_\_user\_constraint](@ref) relationship.
Essentially, [node\_state\_coefficient](@ref) appears as a coefficient for the
[node\_state](@ref) variable of the [node](@ref) in the [user constraint](@ref constraint_user_constraint).
