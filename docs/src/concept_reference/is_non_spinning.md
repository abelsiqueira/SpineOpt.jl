By setting the parameter [is\_non\_spinning](@ref) to `true`, a node is treated as a non-spinning reserve node. Note that this is only to differentiate spinning from non-spinning reserves. It is still necessary to set [is\_reserve\_node](@ref) to `true`.
The mathematical formulation holds a chapter on [Reserve constraints](@ref) and the general concept of setting up a model with reserves is described in [Reserves](@ref).
