The [storages\_invested\_coefficient](@ref) is an optional parameter that can be used to include the [storages\_invested](@ref) variable in a [user\_constraint](@ref) via the [node\_\_user\_constraint](@ref) relationship.
Essentially, [storages\_invested\_coefficient](@ref) appears as a coefficient for the
[storages\_invested](@ref) variable in the [user constraint](@ref constraint_user_constraint). For more information, see the [User Constraints Concept Reference][#User-Constraints]
