# Example Models

The *SpineOpt.jl* repository includes a folder `examples` for ready-made example models.
Each example is its own sub-folder, where the input data is provided as `.json` or `.sqlite` files.
This way, you can easily get a feel for how SpineOpt works with pre-made datasets,
either through [Spine Toolbox](https://github.com/Spine-project/Spine-Toolbox), or directly from the Julia REPL.
The example models included in the *SpineOpt.jl* repository are briefly explained in the following sections.
