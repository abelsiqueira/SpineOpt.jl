# Example Models

The *SpineOpt.jl* repository includes a few ready-made example models based on the case studies performed in the project.
These are included in sub-folders under `examples\`, where the input data is provided as `.json` or `.sqlite` files.
This way, you can easily get a feel for how SpineOpt works with pre-made datasets,
either through [Spine Toolbox](https://github.com/Spine-project/Spine-Toolbox), or directly from the Julia REPL.
The example models included in the *SpineOpt.jl* repository are briefly explained in the following sections.
